NodeISP integrates with MYOB to provide seamless synchronisation of your financial data. This integration allows you to:

- Automatically synchronise customers from NodeISP to MYOB
- Automatically synchronise invoices and payments from NodeISP to MYOB
- Automatically synchronise payments from NodeISP to MYOB

## Self-Hosted

If you are self-hosting NodeISP, you will need to apply for a MYOB Developer account and create an API key. You can do
this by following the instructions on the [MYOB Developer Portal](https://developer.myob.com/).

Once you have created an API key, you will need to enter the following details into the NodeISP dashboard:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

## Cloud-Hosted

If you are using the cloud-hosted version of NodeISP, you can skip the above steps, and simply enable the MYOB
integration within the `Settings` -> `Integrations` section of the Admin Panel.
